- **Introduction slides:**
    - [Overview](https://open.essex.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/221375/mod_resource/content/27/StudyOverview.pdf) (specific data files description from Slides 80 to 82; naming convention in Slides 92 - 93)
    - [Data Access](https://open.essex.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/221379/mod_resource/content/9/DataAccess.pdf) (names of datasets, descriptions and serial numbers in Slides 3, 4 and 5)
    - [Walkthrough the USoc website](https://open.essex.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/221383/mod_resource/content/13/WebsiteWalkThrough.pdf)
    - [Longterm Content Plan](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/sites/default/files/downloads/general/long-term-content-plan.pdf) (showing the frequency of datasets from Wave 1 in 2009 to Wave 16 in 2020)
    - [Geographical Identifiers](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/linked-data/geographical-identifiers)
- Identiying individuals and households:
    - Using **`pidp`**: Unique person identifier to link across waves and across files within the same wave. This identifier is constant, unique within and across waves.
    - Using **`w-pidp`**: Household identifier to identify members of the same households within one wave. Not constant, so *cannot be used to link households across waves* (no concept of longitudinal household)
- **Data Structure (Graphs only)**

## 2. Some important notes

- USoc has subsample for Ethinic minorities (**Ethnic Minority Boost sample and an Immigrant and Ethnic Minority Boost sample).** The Boost sample is to improve the analysis of under-represented groups of people by oversampling such groups.
- The USoc made up of 2 big datasets: _**BHPS**_ (from 1991 to 2008) and _**UKHLS**_ (from 2009 until now). Key changes in the datasets timeline are:
    
    - üóìÔ∏è 1991 Interviews (Started as **BHPS**) ‚áí 2001 Interviews ‚áí 2009 Interviews (Changed to **UKHLS**) ‚áí 2015 interviews
    - Each annual interview is referred to as a _**wave**_. There are are 31 waves now.
    - Using the dataset for analysis during a long period of time, therefore, should find a way to incorporate data from all _**waves**_ 

- After the first surveys (original sample), other surveyees in next waves are all connected to the original sample in some ways
